[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.1-blue.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-green.svg)](https://github.com/GowlikarAjitesh/auto_import_flutter_package)

**Flutter Package Manager** is a powerful Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension designed to streamline the **management of Flutter packages** in your project's `pubspec.yaml` file. With an intuitive interface and seamless integration, it simplifies package management, saving developers time and effort. The repository also includes a companion extension, **Flutter Dependency Fixer**, to address dependency-related issues.

## Prerequisites

- **Flutter**: Ensure Flutter is installed and configured on your system.
- **VS Code**: Use Visual Studio Code with a Flutter project open (must include a `pubspec.yaml` file in the workspace root).
- **Node.js**: Required for building the extension from source.



## Features

- **Quick Package Search**:
  - Trigger with `Ctrl+Shift+A` to open a Quick Pick UI.
  - Search packages using a responsive search bar, prefilled with selected text for faster lookups.
  - Displays up to 10 package suggestions with name, version, and description.

- **Toggle Installed/Uninstalled Packages**:
  - Toggle button to switch between installed and uninstalled packages.
  - Dynamically updates search results based on toggle state.

- **Add/Delete Packages**:
  - Add packages with a `+` icon, silently updating `pubspec.yaml`.
  - Remove installed packages with a `√ó` icon, marked as "Already installed."
  - Executes `flutter pub get` in the background without opening a terminal.

- **Hover Information**:
  - Hover over package names in `pubspec.yaml` to view detailed descriptions and available methods (placeholder due to pub.dev API limitations).
  - Presented in a clean, Markdown-formatted tooltip.

- **Robust and Efficient**:
  - Comprehensive error handling for missing or invalid `pubspec.yaml` files.
  - Caches package data for faster searches.
  - Responsive UI with clear icons and text for an intuitive experience.

## Installation

### From VS Code (Easy Way)

1. Download the `.vsix` files from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/GowlikarAjitesh/auto_import_flutter_package).  **(This is the same Repository, just scroll up)**
   - `auto-import-flutter-0.1.1.vsix` (Flutter Package Manager)
   - `flutter-dep-fixer-0.0.1.vsix` (Flutter Dependency Fixer, optional)
2. Open VS Code.
3. Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS).
4. Click the **...** menu and select **Install from VSIX**.
5. Drag and drop or browse to each `.vsix` file and install.

### From GitHub Repository
To build and install the extension from source:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GowlikarAjitesh/auto_import_flutter_package.git
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd auto_import_flutter_package
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure Node.js is installed, then run:
    ```bash
    npm install
4. **Compile the Code**:
      Build the extension using esbuild:
    ```bash
    npm run build
5. **Package the Extension**:
Create a .vsix file using vsce:
    ```bash
    npm run package
    
**Note:** This generates a file like flutter-package-manager-0.0.1.vsix in the project root.

6. **Install the Extension**: Follow the "From VS Code" steps above to install the .vsix file.

### Development (Debug Mode)

Open the project in VS Code.

Press Ctrl+Shift+F5 (or F5 for standard debugging) to launch the Extension Development Host.

A new VS Code window will open; open a Flutter project in this window to test the extension.
